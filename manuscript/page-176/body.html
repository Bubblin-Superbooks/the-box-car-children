The bed was snow white with a thick quilt of violet silk. On the little table were English violets, pouring their fragrance into the room.</p><p>"What a beautiful room!" sighed Violet, sinking down into one of the soft cushioned chairs.</p><p>But all the children shouted when they saw Benny's room. The wallpaper was blue, covered with large figures of cats and dogs, the Three Bears, and Peter Rabbit. There was a swinging rocking-horse, nearly as large as a real horse, a blackboard, a tool chest, and low tables and chairs exactly the right size for Benny. There was an electric train with cars nearly as large as the little boy himself.</p><p>"Can I run the cars all day?" asked Benny.</p><p>"Oh, no," replied Henry quickly. "You're going to school as soon as it begins."</p></div> </div>
