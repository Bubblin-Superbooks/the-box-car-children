He held up his front foot.</p><p>"Poor doggie," murmured Jess soothingly, as she clambered out of the car. "Let Jess see your poor lame foot." She approached the dog carefully, for she remembered that her mother had always told her never to touch a strange dog unless he wagged his tail.</p><p>But this dog's tail was wagging, certainly, so Jess bent over without fear to look at the paw. An exclamation of pity escaped her when she saw it, for a stiff, sharp thorn had been driven completely through one of the cushions of the dog's foot, and around it the blood had dried.</p><p>"I guess I can fix that," said Jess briskly. "But taking the thorn out is going to hurt you, old fellow."</p><p>The dog looked up at her as she laid his paw down, and licked her hand.</p></div> </div>
