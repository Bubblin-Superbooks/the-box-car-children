He learned very readily that two and one make three.</p><p>"I knew that before," he said cheerfully. But it was a different matter when Jess proposed to him that two minus one left one.</p><p>"No, it does not left <em>one</em>," said Benny indignantly. "It left <em>two</em>."</p><p>"Why, Benny!" cried Jess in astonishment. "Supposing you had two apples and I took away one, wouldn't you have one left?"</p><p>"You never would," objected Benny with confidence.</p><p>"No, but supposing Watch took one," suggested Jess.</p><blockquote><p><em>One day the stranger was allowed to see Violet</em>
"Watchie wouldn't take one, neither," said Benny. "Would you, doggie?"</p></blockquote><p>Watch opened one eye and wagged his tail. Jess looked at Violet in despair. "What shall I do with him?" she asked.</p></div> </div>
