She patted his head and stroked his nose with one finger, and offered him the rest of her breadcrust, which she had put in her apron pocket. The dog snapped it up as if he were nearly starved. Then she held the soft paw firmly with her left hand, and pulled steadily on the thorn with her right hand. The dog did not utter a sound. He lay motionless in her lap, until the thorn suddenly let go and lay in Jess' hand.</p><p>"Good, good!" cried Violet.</p><p>"Wet my handkerchief," Jess ordered briskly.</p><p>Violet did so, dipping it in the running brook. Jess wrapped the cool, wet folds around the hot paw, and gently squeezed it against the wound, the dog meanwhile trying to lick her hands.</p><p>"We'll s'prise Henry, won't we?" laughed Benny delightedly. "Now we got a dog!"</p></div> </div>
