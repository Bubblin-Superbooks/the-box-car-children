<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With Benny sitting by to watch proceedings, Jess mapped out a remarkable Teddy-bear. One stocking, carefully trimmed, made the head and body, while the other furnished material for two arms, two legs, and the stuffing. Jess worked hard over the head, pushing the padding well into the blunt nose. Violet embroidered two beautiful eyes in black and white, and a jet black nose-tip.</p><p>"You must make a tail, too, Jessy," said Benny, watching her snip the brown rags.</p><p>"Bears don't have tails, Benny," argued Jessâ€”although she wasn't exactly sure she was right. "Your old bear didn't have any tail, you know."</p><p>"But <em>this</em> bear has a tail, though," returned Benny, knowing that Jess would put on two tails if he insisted.</p><p>And it was true. His bear finally did have a tail.</p><p>"What <em>kind</em> of tail?" asked Jess helplessly at last. "Bushy, long and slim, or cotton-tail?"</p></div> </div>
