They pressed the hay back firmly until they had made their way into Violet's little room. And then she in turn groped until she found Benny.</p><p>"Hello, little Cinnamon!" whispered Violet playfully.</p><p>And Benny at once made up his mind to laugh instead of cry.

If you don't mind, you will be in danger. Do you understand?"</p><p>"Don't I have to mind Jess and Violet too?" asked Benny.</p></div> </div>
