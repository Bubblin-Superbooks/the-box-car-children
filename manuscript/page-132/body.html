As they turned into red-hot ashes and began to topple over one by one into the glowing pile, Jess laughed delightedly. She had already scrubbed the smooth potatoes and dried them carefully. She now poked them one by one into the glowing ashes with a stick from a birch tree. Whenever a potato lit up dangerously she gave it a poke into a new position. And when Henry found her, she was just rolling the charred balls out onto the flat stones.</p><p>"Burned 'em up?" queried Henry.</p><p>"Burned, nothing!" cried Jess energetically. "You just wait!"</p><p>"Can't wait, hardly," replied Henry smiling.</p><p>"You said that a long time ago," said Benny.</p><p>"Well, isn't it true?" demanded Henry, rolling his brother over on the pine needles.</p></div> </div>
